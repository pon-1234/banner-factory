# Fonts

Place required OpenType font files in this directory before building the compositor image.

Recommended defaults:
- `NotoSansJP-Bold.otf`
- `NotoSansJP-Regular.otf`

These fonts are loaded at runtime if present. In local development, the compositor falls back to Canvas defaults when fonts are missing.
